A short fallen tower in a shady cliff side marks the entrance to this dungeon.$ Beyond the fallen tower lies a grand, clammy room.$ It's covered in small bones, bat droppings and ash.$
A massive granite door in a murky swamp marks the entrance to this dungeon.$ Beyond the overgrown boulder lies a massive, shady room.$
A modest broken temple in a somber swamp marks the entrance to this dungeon.$ Beyond the broken temple lies a scanty, weary room.$ It's covered in dead insects, rubble and rat droppings.$
A small overgrown boulder in a misty marsh marks the entrance to this dungeon.$ Beyond the overgrown boulder lies a massive, shady room.$ It's covered in moss, dead vermin and large bones.$
A grand waterfall in a shady mountain base marks the entrance to this dungeon.$ Beyond the waterfall lies a grand, damp room.$ It's covered in small bones, rat droppings and cobwebs.$
A grand wooden door blocks your path.$ Countless odd symbols are all over it, somehow untouched by time and the elements.$ You step closer to inspect it and wait, you hear a faint laugh coming from behind the door.$
You've found the long-lost treasure chamber! Sadly, it has already been completely emptied by earlier adventurers.$ The only exit is to the south.$
The narrow passage bends here from west to north.$ The smell of gold permeates the air.$
A steep cliff appears before you, falling into the darkness.$ Ahead to the north, a light flickers in the distance, but there is no way across the chasm.$
Dim light filters in from the south.$ Dusty passages run north and east.$
